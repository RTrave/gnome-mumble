# gnome-mumble
This GNOME extension adds an "Mumble Overlay" menu entry when right-clicking an application in the dash or in the activities overview.
Selecting it will launch the application with [Mumble](http://mumble.info/)'s mumble-overlay command , without having to open a terminal and do it manually.
It's a clone of the gnome-optirun extension from Laurent Treguier.
